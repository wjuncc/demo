# tutorial of powershell winfrom #


Creating winform interface is an easy task and  happy experience with coding in powershell, which is  harder created in C# with visual studio in developing a same function. The code will be very clear without complex communication object. Also we will catch the error message in terminal easily instead of avoiding the complex debug system in vs.

The communication betweeen powershell and python is very simple. Just only one statements likes below, could be input the data from python file:
```powershell

```
and make as script to reflect python file. 
In this way that the ui-interface could be created handy and easily
