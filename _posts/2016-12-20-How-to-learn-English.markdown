# How to learn English #

Why I Stopped Being a Grammar Snob
为什么我停止成为一个语法的鼻涕
(And why you probably should, too)
（为什么你可能也应该）
I used to be a proud grammar snob.
我曾经是一个傲慢的语法势利。
I secretly reveled in my schadenfreude when people muddled their (there? theyre?) homonyms.
当人们把他们（那里？他们？）同音异义词混淆时，我偷偷地为我的幸灾乐祸而欢欣鼓舞。
I had inflexible opinions on the subject of comma use.
关于逗号使用的问题，我有一些不灵活的意见。
I laughed at people who used whom incorrectly.
我嘲笑那些错误使用谁的人。

And then I took a linguistics class that changed my whole outlook, not just on grammar but also on the social impact of language.
然后，我参加了一个语言学课，改变了我的整个观点，不仅仅是语法，还有语言的社会影响。
It sounds dramatic, I know, but in university youre allowed to have dramatic epiphanies.
我知道这听起来很戏剧化，但是在大学里你可以有戏剧性的顿悟。

The class was called Introduction to the English Language which is a boring title.
这个班被称为英语简介，这是一个无聊的标题。
I doubt many people would have taken it except that it was mandatory for English majors at my university.
我怀疑许多人会采取，除了这是我的大学英语专业强制性的。
Not only did it sound boring but it also seemed a little ridiculous.
这不仅听起来很无聊，而且看起来有些荒谬。
An intro to English?
英语介绍？
Most of us were native speakers.
我们大多数是母语人士。
Wed chosen to study English literature.
星期三选择学习英语文学。
We held obnoxious opinions about punctuation.
我们对标点符号抱有厌恶的意见。
It seemed a little late for an introduction to the English language.
英语介绍似乎有些晚了。

It turned out to be one of my favourite classes ever.
原来，这是我最喜欢的课程之一。

I had gone in expecting to be force fed academic dogma on the right way to use English.
我曾经期待以正确的方式使用英语，成为学术教条。
I imagined a man in tweed railing against the use of slang and the deplorable state of, like, teenage vernacular.
我想象一个穿着粗花呢的人，反对使用俚语，还有像十几岁的白话那样可悲的状态。
Even for a self-professed grammar snob it sounded a bit much.
即使对于一个自称为语法的势利者来说，听起来也有点多。
You see, the true mark of a grammar snob is she doesnt like to be told how to use grammar herself;
你看，一个语法滑稽的真正标志是她不喜欢被告知如何使用语法自己;
she just likes to tell other people that theyre wrong.
她只是喜欢告诉别人他们错了。

The prof did turn out to be dressed in tweed (he was British and his uniform was a three piece tweed suit) but other than that he bore no resemblance to the pedantic guy Id expected.
这位教授确实穿着粗花呢（他是英国人，他的制服是一件三件套粗花呢套装），但除此之外，他与预期的迂腐家伙没有任何相似之处。
Instead he called all our assumptions about language into question.
相反，他把我们所有关于语言的假设都称为问题。
The lectures were about the way words are invented, and how slang can be creative and even poetic.
这些讲座是关于词语发明的方式，以及俚语是如何创造性的，甚至是诗意的。
We examined the perceived value of different accents.
我们检查了不同口音的感知价值。
We discussed the need for a third, genderless pronoun for those who identify as neither a he nor a she.
我们讨论了为那些既不认同他也不认同她的人的第三个无性别代名词的需要。
One morning, in his clipped Home Counties accent, the prof opened class by saying very calmly :  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits.
有一天早上，在他家乡县的口音里，教授打开了课堂，非常冷静地说：_...屎，小便，他妈的，cu，cocksucker，娘，山雀。
You might recognize these as the words that George Carlin says you cant say on television.
你可能认识到这些是乔治·卡林（George Carlin）说你不能在电视上说的话。
Why do these words have power?
为什么这些话有力量？
We spent the rest of the class discussing the sound structure of curse words and why it feels good to drop an f-bomb.
我们在班上的其他同学中讨论了咒语的健全结构，以及为什么放弃生物弹是很好的。

The most important thing I learned, though, was that there is no such thing as standard English with a capital E. Instead there are many englishes with a lower case E. There is the english of the Caribbean and the english of the southern United States
然而，我所学到的最重要的事情是，不存在大写字母E的标准英语。而是有许多小写字母E。加勒比英语和美国南部的英语
and the english of Oxbridge and the english rappers use in their music.
牛津英语和英语说唱歌手在他们的音乐中使用。
Traditionally were taught that one of these is better than the rest, but in this class I learned that thats an arbitrary distinction and not necessarily the case.
传统的教导是，其中的一个比其他的要好，但在这个班级里，我知道这是一个任意的区别，不一定是这样。

Why?
为什么？
Well, there are two schools of thought when it comes to how we should use language.
那么，谈到我们应该如何使用语言，有两个思想流派。
One is prescriptive and its backed by grammar snobs and the kind of people who froth at the mouth over the decline of the Kings English.
一个是规定性的，它是由语法势力势力和那些在国王英语的衰落中起泡沫的人支持的。
The other is descriptive and its more about accepting that how people use language is how language works.
另一个是描述性的，更多的是接受人们如何使用语言是语言如何工作。
A prescriptivist believes in the idea of standard English and sees mistakes everywhere.
规定主义者相信标准英语的概念，并且在任何地方都能看到错误。
A descriptivist sees many englishes, and none of them are standard.
一个描述主义者看到许多事物，没有一个是标准的。

Of course theres got to be a happy medium somewhere.
当然，他们在某个地方是一个快乐的媒介。
Without a set of common rules we cant communicate effectively.
没有一套共同的规则，我们不能有效地沟通。
But does it really further communication to obsessively monitor someone who said me and Sarah are going to the store instead of Sarah and I?
但是是否真的进一步沟通来迷恋地监视有人说我和莎拉要去商店而不是莎拉和我？
No.
没有。

The way people speak and write is based on a lot of factors.
人们说话和写作的方式基于很多因素。
Geography, for one.
地理，一个。
The various communities you belong to are also a big influence.
你所属的各个社区也是一个很大的影响力。
Most of us belong to several communities and speak a little differently in the context of each one, whether that community is found at work, on a sports team, in a particular ethnic group, or in a religious community.
我们大多数人都属于几个社区，每个社区都有不同的表述，无论这个社区是在工作中，在运动队，在某个特定的族群还是在宗教社区。
Were all fluent in more than one english, for example the language of our peer group and the language of our parents generation.
我们都能流利地说一个以上的英语，例如我们的同龄人的语言和父母一代的语言。

And then there are the two factors that have possibly the biggest impact on how we use language :  education and socioeconomic status.
其次，有两个因素可能对我们如何运用语言教育和社会经济地位产生最大的影响。
When you judge people for what you consider to be poor grammar, youre judging them for not being as good as you at something that might be a challenge because they didnt have the advantages or experience you did.
当你认为人们认为你的语法不好时，你会认为他们不像你那么好，因为他们没有你所拥有的优势或经验。
Maybe they havent had the luxury of worrying about their grammar.
也许他们没有担心他们的语法的奢侈。
Maybe their use of language is right in line with their community.
也许他们对语言的使用恰好符合他们的社区。
Maybe youre just being a pedantic, prescriptivist jerk.
也许你只是一个迂腐的规定主义混蛋。

I still think grammar is important, but I no longer think there is one set of rules.
我仍然认为语法是重要的，但我不再认为有一套规则。
Sure, I have personal preferences about the way I choose to use language.
当然，我对我选择使用语言的方式有个人偏好。
However when it comes to other people I find that what they have to say is more important and interesting than how they say it.
然而，当谈到其他人时，我发现他们所说的比他们如何表达更重要和有趣。

These days, Im a recovering grammar snob.
这些天，我正在恢复语法势利。
Commas are still my kryptonite, but Im working on it.
逗号仍然是我的氪石，但我正在努力。
